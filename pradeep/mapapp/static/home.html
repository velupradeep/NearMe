<i><u><h>MY HOME :</i></u></h>
<u1>

<li>Home is a safe haven and a comfort zone.</li> 
<li>A place to live with our families and pets and enjoy with friends.</li>
<li> A place to build memories as well as a way to build future wealth.</li>
<li> A place where we can truly just be ourselves.</li>
<li>My house is my most favourite place in the world.</li>
<li> I live with my mother and father in my house. </li>
<li>My house has three floors and lots of stairs.</li>
<li> We have a garden outside our house with beautiful flowers.</li>
<li>Maybe the reason you can never go home again is that, once you're back, you can never leave.</li>
